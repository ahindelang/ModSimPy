    "* Temperature changes for the fluid do not significantly change density. We choose based off of the listed temperature from the [Engineering Toolbox Chart](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/liquids-densities-d_743.html \"Engineering Toolbox\").\n",
    "* The force the penguin exerts on the fluid does not change based on fluid density. We made this assumption because it makes sense that there is a maximum force the penguin can exert regardless of density. For example, if it was pushing against an infinitely dense solid it could not exert an infinite force. However, it also makes sense that there would be a fluid that was not dense enough to exert maximum force onto it (like air). We chose to ignore this because although we have fluids heavier and lighter than sea water, they are not at either extreme.\n",
    "* Penguins flap their flippers 50% of the time when exerting maximum force.\n",
    "* When penguins reset their flippers back to the ready to propel positions, they do not push themselves backwards at all. This assumption was made because we figured the force would be relatively small as penguins are efficient and aerodynamic swimmers."

    "\n",
    "To compute the average force of the penguin swimming, we back-calculate it based off of the drag force. The assumption is that, at terminal velocity, the force of the penguin is equal to the drag force. Therefore, the force of the penguin has the same magnitude but opposite direction of the drag force at the penguin's maximum speed in salt water.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instantaneous Penguin Force\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can find the average force of the penguin on the fluid, this force is not constant. To move, the penguin must move its flippers in the water to propel itself. When the penguin is pushing back into the water, it exerts force on the fluid and accelerates. When the penguin is pulling its flippers from back to front, it is setting itself up for another push and is slowing down due to the drag force of the water. It is not accelerating at this point.\n",

    "To account for this, we need to find the instantaneous penguin force. This will allow us to find the instantaneous acceleration. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sawtooth Force Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the penguin is only exerting a force around 50% of the time, a sawtooth model seemed like a logical first step. The assumption that the penguin only exerts force around 50% of the time is a rough estimate from watching [Gentoo penguins swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TXKiz_DGc4 \"Video\"). We also liked the sawtooth model because a penguin is going to have times when it makes better contact with the water and can exert more force, just as  a Sawtooth model slopes to a point and goes back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sawtooth function has a period which matches the flapping rate of our penguin. The magnitude of the sawtooth wave is four times the average force exerted by the penguin (More on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sawtooth function is zero or below, an \"if\" statement is used to set the force exerted by the penguin to zero. This is another assumption that the penguin does not push itself backwards while resetting itself. Penguins are relatively aerodynamic and efficient so this is logical. \n",

This seemed more representative of how a penguin pushes against the water: The maximum surface area of the flipper is used to propel the penguin halfway through a \"flap\". Towards the beginning and end of the motion the penguin is much less efficient than in the middle.\n",

    "The wavelength matches the flap rate of the penguin. The amplitude is pi * f_penguin_avg (where f_penguin_avg is the average force of the penguin on the fluid).

    "#### How the Output and Model answered the Question\n",
    "Our Model helped us to answer the question by giving us a quantantative and visual answer. The Position vs Time plot and total time print out gave us an overall view of how different fluids change the time it takes the penguin to cover distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Velocity vs Time plot gave us a good visualization of how a penguin swims. Printing out values such as the max speed and average speed provided a quantative look at the peak velocity the Gentoo penguin was able to reach in each substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this in a Python model instead of with a fully algebraic model (Such as one that could be done by hand) allowed us to easily track velocity over time. This is especially seen in how we modeled the force of the penguin on the fluid, as this changes multiple times per second due to the flapping of the penguin's flippers. Using a Python model also made it easy to test multiple fluids quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, having both a position vs time plot and velocity vs time plot, as well as printed summary statements, made it easy to glance just at the results and understand the quantitative, rather than qualitative relationship between penguin movement at different fluids.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Limitations\n",
    "All in all, our model does an effective job answering our original question with sufficient accuracy. However, there could be some improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to results, the code does not allow for simple comparison between simulations--readers must compare the distinction between different trials for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also did not have time to add different penguins, who may have different results. However, the model does allow for the penguin parameters to be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because penguins tend to swim in very cold water, the assumption that temperature changes play little role in the density of the fluid may be an incorrect one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though a wave function modeling the movement of the penguin's wings and the non-constant force it produces was a good step, it could perhaps have a level of error. Penguins may not swim at full speed for the whole time, so considering the stamina of the penguin could be a next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iteration\n",
    "The biggest iteration our model went through was the change in how we represented the force of the penguin. Originally, our penguin's force was constant, just equivalent to the average force as derived from the drag equation. Although this gave us very similar total time results to our current model, this force model does not accurately represent how a penguin exerts force on the water. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we tested two seperate functions to model the penguin's force exerted on the water: a sawtooth and sine wave. This can be clearly seen in the Velocity vs Time plots. This is another place where our Python model allows us to do more than a simple algebraic one could reasonably accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major area of iteration was in the presentation of data. Originally, there were just the Position vs Time and Velocity vs Time plots. Although these technically display all the essential data, they are hard to parse and quickly differentiate between different fluids. Adding summary statements for the performance of the penguin (total time, max speed, average speed) helped this vastly."
